# Modeling-Climate-Anomalies-with-Statistical-Analysis
Overview
This project provides a visual analysis of climate data collected from various weather stations. The focus is on analyzing daily temperature extremes and precipitation patterns using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The analysis includes the creation of histograms, box-and-whisker plots, and other graphical summaries to compare climate patterns across different stations.

Features
Data Loading: Read and preprocess climate data from a CSV file.
Temperature Histograms: Compare maximum and minimum temperatures across stations using customizable histograms.
Precipitation Analysis: Create box-and-whisker plots to analyze precipitation patterns for different stations.
Station Comparisons: Visualize climate variations (temperature and precipitation) between selected weather stations.
Density Plots: Visualize temperature distributions using density histograms for better comparison.
