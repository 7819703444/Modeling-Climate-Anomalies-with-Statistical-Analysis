# Visual_Climate_Data

## Overview
This project provides a visual analysis of climate data collected from various weather stations. The focus is on analyzing daily temperature extremes and precipitation patterns using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. The analysis includes the creation of histograms, box-and-whisker plots, and other graphical summaries to compare climate patterns across different stations.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Read and preprocess climate data from a CSV file.
- **Temperature Histograms**: Compare maximum and minimum temperatures across stations using customizable histograms.
- **Precipitation Analysis**: Create box-and-whisker plots to analyze precipitation patterns for different stations.
- **Station Comparisons**: Visualize climate variations (temperature and precipitation) between selected weather stations.
- **Density Plots**: Visualize temperature distributions using density histograms for better comparison.
  
## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Visual_Climate_Data.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Visual_Climate_Data
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dependencies
